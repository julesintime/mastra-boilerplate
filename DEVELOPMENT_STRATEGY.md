# Development Strategy: Complex Multi-Agent Research & Content Generation System

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a **real-world production application** showcasing complex multi-agent orchestration for **automated research and content generation**. This will demonstrate advanced Mastra capabilities while serving as a practical business solution.

## 🏗️ Application Architecture Overview

### Core Application: **Research Content Orchestrator**
A sophisticated system that can:
- Take high-level research topics or content requests
- Orchestrate multiple specialized agents to gather, analyze, and synthesize information
- Generate comprehensive, well-researched content with citations
- Quality assurance through multi-layer review and fact-checking
- Export results in multiple formats (articles, reports, presentations)

### Target Use Cases
1. **Academic Research Papers** - Automated literature reviews, citation gathering, draft generation
2. **Business Intelligence Reports** - Market research, competitor analysis, trend reports  
3. **Content Marketing** - Blog posts, whitepapers, case studies with thorough research backing
4. **Due Diligence** - Company research, regulatory compliance analysis
5. **Technical Documentation** - API documentation, user guides, technical specifications

## 🔄 Development Strategy: Dual-Track Approach

### Strategy 1: **Feature Branch Workflow** (Recommended)

```
main branch (stable framework)
├── feature/research-content-orchestration (current)
│   ├── feature/research-agents
│   ├── feature/content-generation
│   ├── feature/orchestration-network
│   └── feature/advanced-workflows
└── hotfix/* (framework improvements)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Keeps framework stable while building complex application
- ✅ Easy to merge framework improvements into application
- ✅ Clear separation between framework and application development
- ✅ Industry standard for feature development
- ✅ Allows parallel development of multiple application components

### Strategy 2: **Monorepo with Workspaces** (Alternative)

```
/
├── packages/
│   ├── framework/ (core Mastra framework)
│   ├── research-app/ (research orchestration app)
│   └── shared/ (common utilities)
├── apps/
│   ├── research-demo/ (demo application)
│   └── docs/ (documentation site)
└── examples/
    └── simple-agents/ (basic examples)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Complete separation of framework and applications
- ✅ Multiple applications can share framework
- ✅ Easier dependency management
- ✅ Better for long-term maintainability

### **Recommended Choice: Feature Branch Workflow**

For rapid development and demonstration purposes, the **feature branch workflow** is optimal because:
- Faster iteration and development
- Simpler project structure 
- Easy to showcase integrated capabilities
- Framework improvements can be easily backported
- Industry standard for feature development

## 🧠 Multi-Agent System Design

### Agent Hierarchy & Specialization

#### 1. **Orchestrator Agent** (Master Coordinator)
```typescript
- Role: Task delegation, workflow coordination, quality control
- Capabilities: Parse user requests, create research plans, delegate tasks
- Tools: Task management, agent communication, progress tracking
- Model: GPT-4o (complex reasoning and coordination)
```

#### 2. **Research Agents** (Information Gathering)

**Web Research Agent**
```typescript
- Role: Web scraping, search engine queries, content extraction
- Tools: WebFetch, search APIs, content parsers
- Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro (fast processing, good reasoning)
```

**Academic Research Agent**
```typescript
- Role: Scholarly article search, citation management
- Tools: Semantic Scholar API, PubMed, ArXiv integration
- Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (academic writing expertise)
```

**Data Analysis Agent**
```typescript
- Role: Statistical analysis, data visualization, trend analysis
- Tools: Python execution, data processing libraries
- Model: GPT-4o (mathematical reasoning)
```

#### 3. **Content Generation Agents** (Content Creation)

**Writer Agent**
```typescript
- Role: Draft creation, content structuring, narrative flow
- Tools: Template generation, style guides
- Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (excellent writing capabilities)
```

**Editor Agent**
```typescript
- Role: Content refinement, style consistency, flow optimization
- Tools: Grammar checking, style analysis
- Model: GPT-4o (detailed editing and revision)
```

**Fact Checker Agent**
```typescript
- Role: Verification of claims, source validation, accuracy checking
- Tools: Cross-reference APIs, credibility scoring
- Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro (fact verification)
```

#### 4. **Quality Assurance Agents** (Review & Validation)

**Review Agent**
```typescript
- Role: Final quality review, completeness checking
- Tools: Content analysis, quality metrics
- Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (comprehensive review)
```

**Citation Agent**
```typescript
- Role: Citation formatting, reference management, bibliography
- Tools: Citation style libraries, reference validation
- Model: GPT-4o Mini (structured formatting)
```

### Agent Communication Patterns

#### 1. **Hierarchical Delegation**
```
Orchestrator → Research Agents → Content Agents → QA Agents
```

#### 2. **Peer-to-Peer Collaboration**
```
Writer ↔ Fact Checker ↔ Editor (iterative improvement)
```

#### 3. **Pipeline Processing**
```
Research → Analysis → Writing → Editing → Review → Output
```
